## Overview
**Brute-XMLRPC** is a Python-based tool designed to perform brute force attacks on WordPress sites through the `xmlrpc.php` endpoint. It can also enumerate users via the WordPress REST API (on versions >=4.4) to enhance the attack surface.

## Features
- **`system.multicall`**: Send 1 request with multiple username/password combinations to `/xmlrpc.php` using `system.multicall` (WordPress versions <=4.3 only) OR
- **Brute Force**: Send 1 request per username/password combination to `/xmlrpc.php` using `wp.getUsersBlogs` concurrently (WordPress versions >=1.5.0)
- **IP Spoofing**: Generate random IP addresses for headers like `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` to enhance anonymity.
- **Custom Headers**: Use a variety of headers to mimic real-world browser requests.
- **User Enumeration**: Retrieve user information from the WordPress REST API (WordPress versions >=4.4 only).
- **Interactive Input**: Easy-to-use prompts for user input and configuration.
- **Progress Display**: Real-time display of brute force attempts and progress.
- **WordPress 4.4+ detection**: Detect if version 4.4+ (based on presence of REST API) to intelligently allow version based features.

## **Key Changes and Improvements:**

1. **Proxy Handling with `aiohttp-socks`:**
   - Integrated `aiohttp-socks` for SOCKS5 proxy support, ensuring compatibility with Tor.
   - Replaced direct proxy arguments with `ProxyConnector` for streamlined connection management.

2. **Enhanced Header and User-Agent Spoofing:**
   - Expanded `user_agents` list with mobile browsers, old browsers, and bots.
   - Broadened `referer_domains` and added randomized `Accept-Language`, `Accept-Encoding`, `Forwarded`, `DNT`, `Origin`, and `Cache-Control` headers for increased variety.

3. **Payload Variation in `check_xmlrpc_available`:**
   - Introduced random payloads (`system.getCapabilities`, `system.methodHelp`, etc.) for more robust testing.

4. **Retry Logic and Rate Limiting:**
   - Added retry mechanism with delays and handling of `429` responses using `Retry-After` header.

5. **WAF Detection:**
   - Added `check_for_waf` to identify 403 responses indicating a WAF and log detections in `WAF_DETECTED_LOG`.

6. **Deprecated Method Removal:**
   - Replaced `SocksConnector.create` with `ProxyConnector` for modern and non-deprecated proxy handling.
